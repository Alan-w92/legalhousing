The apartment is fully and very nicely furnished (as is the room for rent) and is a very calming oasis. This is a perfect place for someone seeking a temporary arrangement that feels like home. I am a woman in my late 30's,  I work in education and am an entrepreneur. I enjoy a calm,  peaceful home. I also have a 16 year old cat who lives a very leisurely life.About You:A late 30-something+ professional who is neat,  responsible,  lives a calm life and cares more about people than things.

You are a kind,  balanced and caring human being. The apartment is fully furnished and cozy,  so this is a perfect place for someone who plans to bring no more than what can fit in a 12 x 12 bedroom (surprisingly,  with a good amount of storage space within). I enjoy quiet time and genuine human connection - if you are the same,  I'd love to hear from you!

Walking distance to MIT/Kendall Square,  a super short walk (5-7 min) to the Central Square red line,  and even shorter to buses.Recently renovated kitchen and bathroom,  laundry in building,  option of off-street parking,  bike storage... the list goes on! The apartment officially has two bedrooms,  a living room,  and a study,  but the living room has been used as a bedroom for the past year (has a door so it works great either way!).
