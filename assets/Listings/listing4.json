{"lat": "", "description": "(46 Hanson Street,  Somerville), 4BR, 900, We have a room opening up in our 4 bedroom / 2 bathroom apartment from about March 12 - all of May and perhaps the first week or two of June. We can be flexible on dates - if you'd like to move in March 1st that would be fine. There is also a slight chance the room will be available until about September 12th.The apartment includes a washer and dryer in the unit (not coin operated). The kitchen has a dishwasher,  oven,  gas range stove,  and a microwave. There is a living room with a futon as well. Both bathrooms have showers. The apartment is on the 2nd and 3rd floor of a building in Somerville,  about a 15 minute walk from the Harvard T stop,  a 10 minute walk from Inman Square,  and about a 20 minute walk from the Porter T stop. It's a short walk from numerous bars and restaurants and three different grocery stores. The spacious bedroom with a queen-sized bed has an east facing window that lets in lots of sun during the day,  but is not exposed to any streetlights at night. There is storage space available in the basement as well as in crawlspaces off the bedroom.Rent is $900/month plus utilities. Water,  gas,  and wifi tend to be about $30/month/person in the summer,  and a bit more during colder months. There is a parking space on a private dead-end street just outside the apartment available for $20/month. The owner wants to run the normal background check on a subletter and there may be a nominal fee for this. We would expect first and last month's rent upon commitment to move in.About us - three friendly,  clean,  and outgoing young men,  two are in grad school at Harvard,  one is a consultant. The consultant travels most of the week most weeks for work,  so there would normally only be two other people in the apartment. We like to socialize,  but tend to be fairly busy with work and studying during the week.", "long": "", "heading": "187ft2 - Spacious 1 Room furnished sublet in a 4 bed/2ba apartment near Harvard ", "br": "4", "location": null, "price": "900", "address": "46 Hanson Street", "timestamp": "1455369900.0"},

{"lat": "", "description": "), 3BR, 1250, Dear Internet, My roommates and I have an amazing newly refurbished 3 bedroom/2 bath apartment townhouse floor on East Broadway in Southie. Sadly,  I am relocating for work beginning in April and we're looking for someone to take over one of the rooms. The apartment is 1, 110 sq feet and the open room is roughly 10 ft x 12 ft with a huge closet,  great natural light,  and fantastic proximity to my two roommates. For those of you who like clean clothes--we also have our washer and dryer in unit.We all work in some variety of finance with some longer hours but the home vibe is pretty mellow. Weekends are usually spent road-tripping up to Vermont or New Hampshire for some variety of skiing or hangout time and weekdays we try to get some couch chilling in. It's important to note that each week there is at least a 50% chance you will find yourself watching a forgotten Will Farrell movie on the 60 inch surround sound system. It's relatively unavoidable.Extra perks include our super sweet gas fire place which is perfect for when winter decides to stretch through May/June. Similarly important is our equally sweet private porch for when winter finally goes away. Going one direction,  we're less than a 1 minute walk from the beach and a 10 minute walk from Castle Island. If you head the other way,  in about 10 mins you can find yourself at Stats or Lincoln. Public transit is also great and we're one of the first stops on the 7,  9,  10,  and 11 busses which can drop you anywhere downtown in about 10 minutes door to door. If you like any combination of cozy couches,  waterfront proximity,  sweet bars,  easy transit,  and nice guys,  we'd love to meet you.", "long": "", "heading": "1111ft2 - Spacious bedroom sublet in Southie w/ great roommates ", "br": "3", "location": "Boston", "price": "1250", "address": "906 East Broadway", "timestamp": "1454568180.0"},
