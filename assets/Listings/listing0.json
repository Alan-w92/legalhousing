The North End sits right above Downtown Boston,  and is bound by the Atlantic waterfront to the north and the east. In a sense,  the North End is its own little peninsula. After crossing the Tobin Bridge,  to the west lies Cambridge,  and even further north,  Charlestown. Across the water to the east lies Logan International Airport,  New England's busiest airport that flies over 30 million passengers annually. The North End has maintained its historic,  Italian roots,  and those searching for an apartment will enjoy the rustic,  exposed brick buildings and the tiny cobblestone streets.Although the North End does not have a direct MTBA stop,  there are plenty of surrounding stops and streets leading into the neighborhood. The closest stops are Aquarium on the Blue Line,  Haymarket on the Orange Line,  and North Station. North Station is a commuter rail line travelled by thousands of inbound and outbound commuters from the North Shore and central regions of Massachusetts.", "long": "", "heading": "830ft2 - AMAZING find!

Mature,  open minded,  kind professional women (preferred but I'm open) welcome. Sorry,  the space is too small for couples but an occasional weekend visit can be discussed. The apartment has central A/C,  bright & sunny rooms,  great decor,  roof deck with 360-degree views,  sunset views from every window,  laundry on-site,  modern kitchen,  lots of amenities. Rent is $1000,  plus $250 to cover all utilities,  high-speed Internet and bi-weekly cleaning services for total of $1250 per month.

The apartment is fully and very nicely furnished (as is the room for rent) and is a very calming oasis. This is a perfect place for someone seeking a temporary arrangement that feels like home. I am a woman in my late 30's,  I work in education and am an entrepreneur. I enjoy a calm,  peaceful home. I also have a 16 year old cat who lives a very leisurely life.About You:A late 30-something+ professional who is neat,  responsible,  lives a calm life and cares more about people than things.

You are a kind,  balanced and caring human being. The apartment is fully furnished and cozy,  so this is a perfect place for someone who plans to bring no more than what can fit in a 12 x 12 bedroom (surprisingly,  with a good amount of storage space within).

It is actually a dense urban neighborhood with a considerableamount of green space (the Fens). Although the Fenway consists of a large number of college students,  it also contains a significant population of professionals,  young and old. The famous (or infamous) Landsdowne Street,  bordering the Massachusetts Turnpike on the north and Fenway Park on the south,  is home to many of Boston's most popular clubs and watering holes.

It is actually a dense urban neighborhood with a considerableamount of green space (the Fens). Although the Fenway consists of a large number of college students,  it also contains a significant population of professionals,  young and old. The famous (or infamous) Landsdowne Street,  bordering the Massachusetts Turnpike on the north and Fenway Park on the south,  is home to many of Boston's most popular clubs and watering holes.
