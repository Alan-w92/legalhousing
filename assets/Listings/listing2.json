With our quickly growing database of video showings,  we're changing the way you find an apartment. Why should you have to go to a broker,  or five brokers,  and go on showing after showing of places that don't appeal to you before you find the one you want? Why should you waste your time on hundreds of photos that all look the same,  and may or may not be of the apartment you would see? We're changing that. With Proper Realty,  you can see each apartment,  the WHOLE apartment,  before you go anywhere.At Proper Realty Group,  instead of just taking a few pictures we bring a high definition video camera to the actual apartment,  and walk through the apartment pointing it at everything you'd look at during a showing. Then we let you watch it from home. Be sure to check out our massive (and still growing) database of video walkthroughs at ProperRG.com. Or,  I can put together a customized list of videos of apartments that would fit your needs,  sort of like a virtual showing of several places you might like. When you've found your perfect apartment,  or narrowed it down to just a few,  THEN you see it in person before filling out an application.Contact me today to have a selection of video showings sent right to your email - you'll see more apartments than you could with a physical showing,  without the hassle. Or,  if you've found the place for you,  let me know and I'll get you inside the actual apartment to see everything in person.All information regarding a property for sale,  rental or financing is from sources deemed reliable.

{"lat": "", "description": "$900 (South Boston), 5BR, 900, Hello, I'm looking for a replacement for a townhouse in South Boston. There are 5 of us living there now and I'll be moving out at the end of the month so moving in for March would be preferred but April would be acceptable as well (or anywhere during the month of March). The setup for the available room(s) is a bit strange in that it is actually two smaller rooms,  each approximately 8'x10' on the third floor across the hall from one another.The house is a block away from Local 149 and a liquor store as well as a couple blocks from the beach and right by castle island with easy access to the 5,  7,  9,  10,  and 11 buses. All the guys are young professionals working in the Seaport and Downtown,  ranging from ages 23-28. All are laid back,  we like drinking and having a good time,  in moderation. This is not a frat house and we don't treat it like one. We only have one bathroom,  which sounds like it might be an issue but has never really been a problem as all of our schedules are pretty staggered in the morning and we're,  you know,  dudes.Our mentality has been keep your room however messy you want it but the common areas are kept pretty clean and neat.If the room and place sound interesting,  then feel free to email and we can figure out a time you can check the place out and meet some of the current roommates (obviously they'd like to meet and make sure you vibe well together before moving in).Utilities included,  except for cable/internet,  which will be $20 a month. Coin-op laundry in the basement.

{"lat": "42.417300", "description": "), 4BR, 1050, Hello,  my 3 roommates are moving out in September but I love this place so much I've decided to stay on and look for 3 new roommates.. A LITTLE ABOUT ME,  I'm a 28 year old hard working guy running my own construction business,  My hours are 7am to 4pm most days after that I like to chill out and watch a show or some tv. I like to keep to myself mostly but will be sociable when others are around. I don't party anymore and do not want it to turn into a party house. That's why I am seeking hard working driven professionals such as myself to fill the rooms. College students will be considered in some cases! ABOUT THE APARTMENT,  it's a big 4 bed with 2 rooms and a bathroom on the second floor and 2 rooms and another bathroom on the first floor,  there is a WASHER AND DRYER IN THE UNIT!! Also there is TWO OFF STREET PARKING SPACES to those of you with cars!! Big kitchen/living room area!! All new appliances new kitchen granite countertops!! Brand new carpet in the upstairs rooms,  new hardwood floors on the first floor! A decently big concrete back yard that's fenced off,  perfect for grilling in the summer if that's your thing! NO PETS unfortunately,  but if u have a cat I'm sure a blind eye could be turned. ABOUT THE AREA very nice very quiet part of Medford right on the border of Somerville,  we are a 10 minute walk from Davis sq and we are quiet literally on the doorstep of tufts university which is a 2 minute walk!!! The available room upstairs is $1050 per month and the two downstairs rooms are also $1050 each a month. UTILITIES NOT INCLUDED.
