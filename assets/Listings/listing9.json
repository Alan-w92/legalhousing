The bedroom is huge with a very large closet. Easily fits any sized bed,  desk,  dresser (as you can see in pictures) The common space includes a kitchen (wish dishwasher) and living room and the bathroom is shared. You'd be living with a girl in her mid-20s,  currently studying at MGH. Very laid back,  although we like to keep the apartment tidy.Rent is $1025/month - doesn't include utilities although in the summer months it usually doesn't go above $40/each. No fee to move in. Potential to sign a one year lease starting Sept 1,  2016.The apartment is in the heart of the North End on a street between Salem and Hanover. You get all the perks of being centrally located,  without the craziness of being on either of those streets. Apartment overlooks the Prado (Courtyard with Paul Revere statue). There are actually trees outside our windows (!!) and it's usually very quiet.
