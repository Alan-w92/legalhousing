{"lat": "", "description": "! (Coolidge Corner), 2BR, 1250, Hi! I'm looking to sublet my large,  open private bedroom in a clean two bedroom apartment until the end of August. Fully furnished,  it's in an awesome,  pedestrian-friendly community with great restaurants and easy transport to Boston. The best way of getting around is by taking the T! The apartment is walking distance to the Green Line,  both C & D,  that can take you pretty much anywhere. Getting to downtown Boston takes less than 15 minutes.I moved to California for work so I'm looking to sublet the apartment ASAP! The rent is paid month-to-month for $1250 / month,  with an option to renew the lease in September. If you intend to renew the lease,  there is an option to buy the furniture now for an upfront price and have a reduced rent for the rest of the summer (preferred option for me).The apartment itself has a ton of windows and storage so its nice just to hang out indoors as well go out to the restaurants in the neighborhood. You are welcome to cook in the kitchen and hang out in living room - my roommate is super friendly! She's normally keeps busy with work and hangs out in her room or with friends,  and she's always happy to help. My roommate is in her mid-20s and is a research scientist,  so would love to find someone that has a similar background.", "long": "", "heading": "1500ft2 - Spacious furnished room in Coolidge Corner!

{"lat": "", "description": "), 2BR, 134900, Price above is Canadian Dollars. This cottage is not for everyone,  finishing it is going to cost money. Unless you're outdoorsy,  you'll want more creature comforts. On the drive to the cottage,  you'll pass some of the most breathtaking scenery the world has to offer. And then there's the cottage itself... At the end of a private drive,  set back from a 70' cliff that runs 235 feet along the water,  is a two-story off-grid seasonal 'bungalow' with lovingly crafted details: stained glass,  scalloped-shingle trim,  and a screened porch that overlooks the Great Bras d'Or channel,  the Bird Islands,  and the ocean beyond. The clearing around the cottage is natural growth with wildflowers and an assortment of edible berries. Approximately two-thirds of the 2.5 acre property is forest; maple,  spruce and cherry interrupt small stands of birch trees that provide a privacy buffer to the only adjacent home. The open-concept interior is unfinished. (Space between the large front windows is begging for a stone fireplace.) Propane is used for refrigeration and cooking. Solar panels provide electricity. Casement windows in the bedroom loft catch cross-breezes off the mountain and ocean. The walled end of a twenty foot long screened porch can be shut off to provide a small second bedroom. Currently a generator is needed to supply water from a 250' deep well with a 220V pump to a water tower so,  without upgrades,  rugged types need apply. The outhouse tank is pumped annually; the outdoor screened shower is solar heated. Sunrises are invariably stunning. Night skies are as clear as you're ever likely to see. The property is located approximately 5K from picturesque Kelly's Cove and the friendly New Campbellton community,  and 10K from the Trans-Canada highway leading to Cape Breton Highlands National Park. Nearby are waterfalls,  beaches,  hiking trails and endless opportunities to boat or kayak on the Bras d'Or 'Lakes.", "long": "", "heading": "900ft2 - Cape Breton Nova Scotia Oceanfront Cottage ", "br": "2", "location": "Cape Dauphin Nova Scotia", "price": "134900", "address": "2098 New Campbellton RD", "timestamp": "1462463280.0"},

The rent is $1995/month and no broker free on a 12 month lease.The building,  as you can see,  features the sought after classic Boston Brownstone look with lovely clean brick siding. Even better,  as you walk down St. Germain St towards your covered front door entrance (an underrated but very appreciated feature),  you'll notice,  and probably pause to admire the charm of the entire street's well maintained Brownstones and the light tree canopy covering the roadway. It truly is the most picturesque street in the city,  yes better than Marlborough. The entire block on both sides of the street is managed by the same company and they take pride in their meticulous care of their apartments both inside,  outside,  and yes even the landscaping.Once inside your apartment,  the first thing you will notice is the prominence of exposed brick throughout,  nicely tying in to and maintaining the timeless feel created on the block. The most standout feature,  aside from how much room the space offers,  is the brick fireplace with it's remote control activated fire (perfect for a Boston Winter). Top it off with large closets,  a spacious Galley Kitchen and the private deck area outside and it is clear why this apartment is such a winner.Thanks for reading and I look forward to meeting you and showing you the apartment soon!* This apartment not what you are looking for?

{"lat": "42.423457", "description": ") (Arlington Heights), 3BR, 112, Hello, We have a COUCH available for your temporary stay for whatever reason,  like maybe visiting relatives in the area but prefer not to actually stay with them,  lol,  or between housing,  need to get off campus for the break,  an Internship,  etc.. Stay for a day,  or staying for several weeks is possible. Again,  it would be for the COUCH in the living room only,  which can also be opened up to a bed if desired. It is certainly a LOT cheaper than a hotel or Hostel! Nobody else would be using the living room while someone is staying on the couch,  so you would have a good amount of privacy. To be clear,  if your not here and someone wanted to watch TV in the living room they would do so,  but once you are here and you wanted your privacy and/or go to sleep,  then the living room would be all yours exclusively! Also the living room is in a corner of the apartment,  so everyone is not walking by or through it to get to another part of the apartment,  there is even a curtain that you can close so you would have total privacy,  as well as a dresser to store your belongings. Full use of kitchen and bathroom.$112. per week includes utilities,  WiFi,  etc. for your temporary stay. Convenient to public transportation! If you wanted to stay for less than a week,  it would be $25. per night for 3 or less nights,  or $20. per night for anywhere from 4-6 nights then! This helps us afford to pay for the utility bills!Looking for a female ONLY housemate (preferred by the majority of roommates) in this 3+ bedroom apartment currently consisting of 5 girls and 1 guy. Although we are a household of 6,  you would never know that many of us lived here,  it is always quiet,  and the bathroom is very accessible! We are a laid back and mellow group,  and never have parties either! We would like someone who is respectful,  clean and responsible,  as we are. The kitchen is large and eat-in and available for your use. The Bathroom is good size and always kept clean.I would like to hear about you. What you do,  where are you from and how long do you need the space for. This is a non-smoking and drama free household!It is 3 minute walk to public transportation (77 & 79 bus) in the Arlington Heights area that is very nice and safe,  10 miles to downtown Boston. So you could better determine location as well as length of time needed to travel wherever it is you would need to get to from here,  the address of the actual bus stop is 1201 Massachusetts Ave.,  Arlington,  MA 02476.Thank You!", "long": "-71.175678", "heading": "165ft2 - Female Housemate - International Students are Welcome ", "br": "3", "location": "Weekly", "price": "112", "address": "Not exact", "timestamp": "1461338400.0"},
