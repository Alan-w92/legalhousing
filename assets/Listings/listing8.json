{"lat": "", "description": " (Union Square), 2BR, 750, Beautiful Artist Style Loft in Union SquareI am a senior (m) about to graduate with my BFA in Painting. I have a beautiful loft in Union Square,  Somerville with an extra room and I'm looking to find a cool roommate. The loft has 14ft ceilings,  10Ft tall windows with a beautiful view,  washer and dryer,  and art gallery in complex,  located in a very cool artists community (which also includes many scientists as we are right near MIT). My loft is fully furnished except the room,  bring a bed etc with you. Unlike most of Somerville there is extensive parking available here with a residents permit and you can rent a dedicated spot for a very reasonable rate here on the property. Heat,  hot water,  trash pick up,  on site management during business hours,  plowing all included in the rent. I do not subscribe to cable TV,  I choose instead to keep it simple and just have internet services in my home. The second room,  which is the roommate bedroom,  is a loft style space and I will work with my new roommate to close it off for more privacy. Other details about this unique place can be discussed in person. As for pets,  I have one kitten and cannot add any additional pets.Professional and landlord references required with application.If you are interested,  please write to me with details about yourself,  how you like to have your home set up,  what you would prefer/dislike in a roommate situation.In the backyard of MIT,  close to Harvard,  ample bike and car parking,  beautiful community outdoor space,  on site art gallery and artists association.

{"lat": "", "description": "(35 Upland rd,  Somerville MA), 5BR, 3875, This address is part of a 2 family house and is being rented out by me,  the owner. There are no broker fees. It is also possible to seperately rent the 2 bedroom unit at 35 Upland road which shares the basement,  2 lane garage,  and laundry facilities with this unit for a total of 7 bedrooms. Water,  water heating,  trash fees,  are included in the rent. Electricity and gas heating not included. The house is partly furnished; there is a dining table,  kitchen table,  fridge,  microwave and some other furniture.Pros:- Location is 30 seconds away from Tufts campus and is on a quiet street with very few cars passing by. Just think of all the time you can save on the commute,  which you can instead spend on studying and enjoying life!- House is in great condition with most rooms being painted this year,  great wooden floors,  new carpets etc.- Large shared basement for all of your storage needs- Free laundry in the basement- Space for at least 3 cars in single lane on the garage/driveway and possibly more depending on whether one or both of your neighbors in the upcoming year will have cars. There is also always plenty of on-street parking for which you can get a free permit at the Somerville parking office.- Spacious,  double living/dining room and an enclosed terrace room which is perfect for quiet reading,  napping and relaxing.- Gas heating which will save you a LOT of $ compared to oil heating.- The tenants currently living there have a lot of furniture that they are willing to pass on cheaply should you need some.- There is a relatively large outside hang-out are on top of the garage perfect for BBQs.- Subleases are allowed,  just keep in mind that the responsibility is always on those whose names are on the lease.- Almost new carpets in the living rooms.Possible Cons:- 2 bedrooms are large,  2 average size,  and one is a smaller. Your group may need to adjust the individual rent based on the rooms that the individuals get,  or perhaps do a random draw for the various rooms.- Like virtually all houses in Somerville,  the walls may contain lead which may be hazardous to very small children. Lead notification form will need to be signed.- No dishwasher (but if you need one I may go 50-50 on it).- One and a half bathrooms means that one of them is complete,  but the other one only has the toilet,  sink and NOT the shower.A $750 security deposit refundable at the end of your lease is required upon lease signing. First and last month's rent are due within the following two weeks.The last pic is the pic of the small room. There is room for an office/computer desk in the place where the photograph is taken from.Please feel free to email or call me at show contact info for questions or to set up a booking. Please do not contact me if you are an agent or a real estate company.PS,  remember that without a broker fee you are actually paying $323 per month ($3, 875 per year) less than you would be for listings of similar properties put out by real estate agencies.-Andrey", "long": "", "heading": "Less than a min from Tufts,  NO FEE!
