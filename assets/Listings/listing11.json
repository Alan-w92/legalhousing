{"lat": "42.364700", "description": "), 2BR, 1225, I will be away this summer and I am looking for someone to sublease my 1bedroom/bathroom starting May 12th and ending Aug 23rd (flexible dates). The apartment is a 2 bedroom/ 2 bathroom apartment so you will have your own private bedroom and bathroom,  but you will share the living room and kitchen with my roommate who is a 28 years old female working at a company in Cambridge. The room is furnished,  but if you would like to bring your own bedroom furniture,  that should not be a problem.The building is a luxury building which has a fitness room,  laundry in each floor,  community room,  24/7 concierge,  garage,  bike storage,  central AC in each unit,  and literally 10 steps to the red line train/buses! The location is very convenient; 2 whole foods,  Trade Joe's,  post office,  and tons of restaurants and shops. The rent of the 1BR/1BR is $1225 monthly for May and June and $1275 for July and August (the rent increases yearly in July). As for utilities,  your share of the bills is $ 57.07 for Comcast Internet and Cable and $30 for electricity (higher with AC/ heating usage)My roommate and I are looking for someone who likes to keep the place clean and comfortable and who is respectful and friendly. Also,  unfortunately,  I am allergic to cats and dogs so no pets in the apartment please. Moreover,  due to building restrictions,  only one person is allowed to sublease the room and stay in visitors are not allowed either. Finally,  your name will be added to our lease for the duration you are renting the room so you will need to fill in an application rental in order for the the building management to run a background/credit check.E-mail me if interestedThanks", "long": "-71.104200", "heading": "1BR in a 2BR/BR Luxury Apartment ", "br": "2", "location": "Cental Square,  Cambridge", "price": "1225", "address": "Not exact", "timestamp": "1460878200.0"},

Additionally,  the MBTA Davis Square Red Line stop is only a 3 minute walk,  making it an easy 16-minute commute to MIT,  or a 8-minute commute to Harvard. There is also quick and easy access to the northern Boston suburbs via buses from the Alewife station,  making this apartment an excellent opportunity for interns in the Cambridge/Somerville/north Boston area. Finally,  the apartment is also only 6 minutes away from Davis Square,  which offers an eclectic variety of venues,  including BBQ and vegan restaurants,  a comedy club,  an array of bars for dancing and nightlife,  as well as a lovely,  independently owned movie theater - the best in Boston!The monthly rent is $985,  with a cost for utilities and cable/internet (in Summer months,  this is less than a hundred dollars),  which can be prorated for your time staying. My roommates are two engineers and a mental health professional,  and we are planning to move out at the end of the summer,  so there is an opportunity for you to extend the lease if you're interested.Please tell us a little about yourself in your message so we can see if this could be a good fit. The apartment is generally quiet,  but we love having a good time,  and have been known to host parties and barbecues. Available housing dates are from 05/13/16 to 08/31/16 (E.O.L.).

With our quickly growing database of video showings,  we're changing the way you find an apartment. Why should you have to go to a broker,  or five brokers,  and go on showing after showing of places that don't appeal to you before you find the one you want? Why should you waste your time on hundreds of photos that all look the same,  and may or may not be of the apartment you would see? We're changing that. With Proper Realty,  you can see each apartment,  the WHOLE apartment,  before you go anywhere.At Proper Realty Group,  instead of just taking a few pictures we bring a high definition video camera to the actual apartment,  and walk through the apartment pointing it at everything you'd look at during a showing. Then we let you watch it from home. Be sure to check out our massive (and still growing) database of video walkthroughs at ProperRG.com. Or,  I can put together a customized list of videos of apartments that would fit your needs,  sort of like a virtual showing of several places you might like. When you've found your perfect apartment,  or narrowed it down to just a few,  THEN you see it in person before filling out an application.Contact me today to have a selection of video showings sent right to your email - you'll see more apartments than you could with a physical showing,  without the hassle. Or,  if you've found the place for you,  let me know and I'll get you inside the actual apartment to see everything in person.Way Chowshow contact infoProper Realty GroupAll information regarding a property for sale,  rental or financing is from sources deemed reliable.
