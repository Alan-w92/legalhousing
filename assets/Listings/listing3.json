Please note that the max number of guests allowed at the property is 2.About the NeighborhoodHolding a proud reputation as the richest area of Boston,  Beacon Hill is a largely residential neighborhood. Home to graceful brownstone houses (now the city's most exclusive residences) and the gold-domed Massachusetts State House,  this wealthy enclave also houses U.S. senators,  businessmen and their families. A visit to the Nichols House Museum here offers a glimpse of life back in the 19th and early 20th century. The 1804 townhouse still maintains in its possession its original fittings,  furnishings and art. Stroll along Charles Street for delightful vintage shopping or a sumptuous lunch in one of the many charming restaurants here (locals love the Paramount located on 44 Charles Street). Step back into history and walk the Black Heritage Trail to explore the city's historic sites like the 1806 African Meeting House,  the 54th Regiment Memorial and pre-Civil War structures. As one of Boston's oldest communities,  Beacon Hill is a page out of American history. While it retains its past beautifully with red-brick houses,  cobblestone streets and antique stores,  this neighborhood lives very well in the present. Its streets are bike and stroller-friendly (a bonus for young families in the area). Green spaces like the Boston Common offer Beacon Hill residents a chance to relax,  play and enjoy the outdoors. The combination of Beacon Hill's historical past and its lively,  charming present makes it one of the most attractive neighborhoods in Boston.", "long": "", "heading": "750ft2 - Don", "br": "1", "location": null, "price": "1900", "address": "Beacon Hill", "timestamp": "1454950620.0"},

{"lat": "", "description": "/ 1br - $795 Unfurnished Bedroom for Female: March-August 2016 (Coolidge Corne, 1BR, 795, We are looking for a mid-late 20s female to rent out a room in our 3-bedroom apartment. The room is unfurnished and the apartment is a 5-minutes walk from Coolidge Corner. The lease will be for SIX MONTHS: March 1,  2016 -- August 31,  2016. It may be possible to renew the lease for the September 2016 lease year,  though this is not guaranteed. We are looking for someone who is clean,  quiet,  respectful,  and appropriately laid back (i.e.,  no 420/other drugs,  no smokers,  and no hardcore partiers) and who would enjoy joining in on TV/movie nights in the living room and the occasional adult beverage on the terrace (i.e.,  deck overlooking the lovely parking lot out back). \u263aThe ideal roommate is in her late-twenties and either a young professional or graduate student. Undergrads will not be considered (no exceptions,  our landlord does not lease to undergrads).About the apartment: Overall,  the place is very large; we have a living room,  dining room,  eat-in kitchen,  bathroom,  3 bedrooms (with closets),  3 shared storage closets,  and a balcony. Laundry is coin-op in the basement. We get great light in the place most of the day,  so it's super cheerful! The common areas of the apartment are fully furnished. The two roommates staying have been here for between 1 - 4 years.Rent will be $795 per person plus utilities -- heat,  hot water,  electric,  cable/internet -- which range from roughly $60-$130 depending upon the time of year. We tend to keep the heat low in the winter and roommates can choose to pay a little more for electric in the summer months if they wish to use a window unit air conditioner in their bedrooms.The apartment is located within a short walk of the Coolidge Corner and St. Paul Street T stops on the C line,  as well as several B line stops. There is no overnight street parking in Brookline,  so if you have a car you'll have to rent a private space nearby. The neighborhood is generally quiet and safe,  filled with young professionals,  grad students,  and families.Interested? Great! Send us an e-mail with some info about yourself and any questions you might have. We're looking to schedule viewings during February.", "long": "", "heading": " ", "br": "1", "location": null, "price": "795", "address": "Browne St at St. Paul", "timestamp": "1454587980.0"},
