{"lat": "", "description": ". near Davis Square, 1BR, 1000, Hello fellow craigslister!I'm offering up my sunny room near Davis Square,  which will be unoccupied from May 18th - July 5th. If you will be available during the majority,  but not all of that time (and you're interested),  still reach out. Start and end dates might be flexible.About the room:The room itself gets wonderful sunlight. Decorated with art I've been gifted,  personally made,  and acquired throughout the years. It has a queen-sized bed and huge desk for all working/studying needs. There is a chest of drawers and a closet with hangers (large enough to stand/lie down in) that will all be available to you. The rent includes internet+utilities. There is a garage-overhang,  off-street parking spot available. It would cost a bit more as I would have to find a storage location for my vehicle.About the apartment and roomies:The apartment is a 3 bed/2 bath. It's on the 3rd floor of a building with an elevator and wide hallways. The bathroom is shared with one other roommate and the kitchen and living room are shared amongst all 3 roommates. Your roommates will be two awesome women. One roommate is an elementary school teacher and the other a recent grad who works multiple jobs. Both are incredibly friendly and wonderfully considerate. The apartment has centralized A/C and coin-operated laundry machines in the building. Both the room and the apartment are smoke-free (not 4/20 friendly indoors).The apartment is a 10 minute walk down the Somerville Community Bike Path to the lively Davis Square. The bike path is occupied with people walking their dogs,  parents with their children,  and all-around happy humans. It's a large part of what sold me on the apartment/neighborhood. The apartment's also a 10-12 minute walk from Porter Square.You:Can be male or female. The space is incredibly accepting and welcoming,  and I hope that you are same. You should be considerate,  clean,  and conscientious. If you respect and treat the space like it is your own,  there shouldn't be a problem. =DI'm available for apartment viewings on weekends on some weeknights.

{"lat": "", "description": "? Shopping? Eating? Then Live here and Live Happy! 1 Bed (Back Bay / Prudential Center), 1BR, 2325, Hi and thanks for taking a look at my posting!STILL AVAILABLE AS OF March 30th!These 1 bedroom apartments are AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY or out until May 1 and is located in the heart of the Back Bay,  directly adjacent to the Prudential Center and all the Back Bay has to offer. The rent is $2400/month with one half month free and no broker free on a 12 month lease. This makes the rent the equivalent of $2228/month with the half month free factored in and about the same price as an apartment for $2056/month with a broker fee. Talk about value!The building,  as you can see,  features the sought after classic Boston Brownstone look with lovely clean brick siding. Even better,  as you walk down St. Germain St towards your covered front door entrance (an underrated but very appreciated feature),  you'll notice,  and probably pause to admire the charm of the entire street's well maintained Brownstones and the light tree canopy covering the roadway. It truly is the most picturesque street in the city,  yes better than Marlborough. The entire block on both sides of the street is managed by the same company and they take pride in their meticulous care of their apartments both inside,  outside,  and yes even the landscaping.Once inside your apartment,  the first thing you will notice is the prominence of exposed brick throughout,  nicely tying in to and maintaining the timeless feel created on the block. The most standout feature,  aside from how much room the space offers,  is the brick fireplace with it's remote control activated fire (perfect for a Boston Winter). Top it off with large closets,  a spacious Galley Kitchen and the private deck area outside and it is clear why this apartment is such a winner.Thanks for reading and I look forward to meeting you and showing you the apartment soon!If leased by 3/15 I will include a Special Gift as a thank you to the new tenant!* This apartment not what you are looking for? Simply send me a short note about what you are looking for and I will reply back with a custom selection of apartments curated just for you!**If you find something else you prefer on your own,  I would be happy to show it to you.
