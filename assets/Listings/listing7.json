{"lat": "", "description": "), 1BR, 700, A BEAUTIFULLY FURNISHED ROOM IN BRIGHTON (NO BROKER FEE)Well,  it is that time of the year when we get to meet new people and recruit you to be our roommate in this wonderful city!***Some of the basics about us***:Young married couple in our late 20s,  looking for 1 housemate to live with in a condo in Brighton starting anytime from March 1st,  2016. I am a graduate student in the field of Education,  and my husband is a medical resident. We are super easy to get along with,  do not smoke/have pets,  and we love to read,  travel,  cook,  and enjoy good food & movies with friends when we have time. :) The rent would be about 750-800 a month with utilities included. We want to live with people more or less in our age group and who are students or have professional backgrounds.Our condo has 4 bedrooms,  including the master bedroom. There are 2 full baths in the condo,  though one is a private bathroom in our master bedroom. 2 bedrooms are currently occupied by 2 young professions,  one in marketing and the other a Dietitian. They are both clean,  friendly,  and quiet. We all have very busy lives,  but when we do get together,  we like to have a chat,  and sometimes play board games.***The Condo***:It is a 4 bedroom Condo unit on the garden level with 2 full baths. We live in the master bedroom. All rooms are well lit and with plenty of storage. Free parking on the street. The rent is $700 for a carpeted,  furnished room. You only need to bring sheets! The room comes with a bed,  a closet,  a tiny bookshelf,  and 2 desks. Washer and dryer on site (whew!). Comes with a full kitchen for those who love cooking like me! I have plenty of cookware and you do not need to bring anything (unless it's a Le Creuset dutch oven!) We also have access to a nice back yard where we may host wonderful BBQs. \u263a For those medical residents out there who are looking (congrats for matching in Boston!),  our condo is about a mile from St. Elizabeths,  and a 15 minute drive to the Longwood Medical Area (Beth Israel,  Brigham,  Children's),  and also 20 minutes drive to MGH. We are a 2 min walk to the 57 bus (taking you to Kenmore Square),  64 bus (taking you to Cambridge and Central Square) and 501 bus (taking you to financial district and downtown Boston). The neighborhood is quiet,  friendly,  and safe. A short walk to Chandler Pond,  0.6 miles to Newton Golf Course and 2 miles from the Newton Reservoir (if you enjoy walking or jogging,  these are wonderful places to go!)We will share utilities (electricity,  heat,  & internet) by head count,  and it varies from $50-100 depending on the number of people we have in the house and obviously the season.Between my husband and I,  we speak 4 languages (Mandarin,  English,  Spanish,  & Italian),  and we attempt to understand Japanese.The following is quote from a fellow CLer with whom I could not agree more:'We do not like drama queens,  people who are opinionated,  and close-minded; if you are one to leave mean notes or texts complaining about something please go to the next post; if you have a problem just talk to me,  I am really easy to approach and if you are in a bad mood I will do my utmost to cheer you up.I like to cook (desserts) and often cook more than I eat and will gladly share leftovers at no cost to you. Sharing stuff like condiments should be a given as long as you make a point of helping buy more. The same goes for cleaning supplies. Also dishwashers are a must in a kitchen.Paying bills on time! I don't believe in charging people cents,  I rather just round numbers off.There are also a few things that are common courtesy/house rules: cleaning up after one's self avoids a lot of bad blood,  putting the toilet seat down is just common curtsey,  privacy and decency are crucial (we all need our space and a closed door doesn't mean a closed mind),  ask to use other peoples stuff. I also ask people to take their shoes off when they enter the condo to keep our home clean.So if you made it this far and haven't run for the hills in panic you deserve a medal. Shoot me an email if you have any more questions. Tell me who you are,  what you do,  and what are you looking for in condo/housemates. If you like I can send you a facebook invite and you can stalk the crap out of me. If you are satisfied and think we are worthy and no imminent threat to your persona we'd love it we could meet up for a coffee.Happy new year!Sofia", "long": "", "heading": "1 Beautifully Furnished Room Available ", "br": "1", "location": "Brighton", "price": "700", "address": "38 Breck Ave", "timestamp": "1457358120.0"},

{"lat": "", "description": "), 1BR, 2100, THE APARTMENT AND THE BUILDING: Beautiful 1-bedroom 1-bathroom in a classic early-20th-Century blond-brick Fenway building. Thick walls and tall windows. Hardwood floors. Large living room and large bedroom. Renovated kitchen with granite countertop. Dishwasher/disposal. Renovated bathroom. High ceilings--just shy of 10 feet! Roof deck. Rear facing,  so nights are rather quiet.THE NEIGHBORHOOD: On a peaceful residential street,  but only one block from Boylston Street's restaurants,  bars,  and shops. Steps away from the magnificent Emerald Necklace,  one of the country's great city parks,  with jogging trails,  flower gardens (the Victory Garden is around the corner),  and fields. A few minutes' walk from a wide variety of really good and inexpensive restaurants,  including El Pelon (Mexican,  with award-winning burritos) and Rod Dee (Thai) down the street,  as well as Sweet Cheeks BBQ,  Tasty Burger,  Wahlburgers,  and the highly anticipated Tiger Mama; a few minutes further to Indian,  Middle Eastern,  Japanese,  wood-fired pizza at Woody's,  and the well regarded Boston Burger Company. A couple blocks from Target and a 24-hour Star Market (each of which has a Starbucks in it),  and a tad further to Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. Some good coffee shops are close by. The world-famous Museum of Fine Arts is just across the Emerald Necklace. And,  of course,  Fenway Park,  close enough that you can enjoy the unique atmosphere of game days when the Red Sox are in town,  but only if you want to: the crowd tends to avoid residential blocks like ours.GETTING AROUND: Walking distance (about 8-10 minutes) to the Green Line subway and also the #1 bus to Cambridge,  and about a 7-minute walk to Yawkey station on the Commuter Rail (Framingham/Worcester line to South Station). About a 25-minute door-to-door trip to downtown Boston on the Green Line,  and less on the Commuter Rail. Close to Kenmore Square and the Back Bay. Walking distance to Berklee,  the Boston Conservatory,  the New England Conservatory (free concerts at Jordan Hall!),  MassArt,  Northeastern,  Simmons,  Wheelock,  Wentworth,  Emmanuel,  Mass. Pharmacy,  Harvard Medical School,  much of the Longwood Medical Area,  and parts of Boston University.If you drive,  easy access to Storrow Drive,  Memorial Drive,  Route 9,  the Riverway/Jamaicaway,  and the Massachusetts Turnpike. A private parking space is available for rent,  right behind the apartment.AND... Laundry in the building. Heat and hot water included; you only pay for electric. Free WiFi.

The Davis Square area is a very lively,  young neighborhood with lots of cafes,  restaurants,  brunch places and bars. There are also festivals that happen along Holland Street during the summer. Across the street from us is an amazing fresh pasta/sandwich store.The room is in a 4 bedroom house and there are two bathrooms shared among the four of us. The room has a built in AC unit and will come furnished. We have a large eat-in kitchen,  a living room,  a large dining room area,  and a porch (definitely great for summer weather). Overall,  there's a lot of common space for you to use.I've lived with my roommates for two years now and they'll be a great resource for getting tips about how to navigate Cambridge/Boston.
