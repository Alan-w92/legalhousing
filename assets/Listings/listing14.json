The room is large with its own closet and a beautiful view of downtown Boston. The room also has individual heat and AC. The bathroom is shared with one other person.The apartment is on the 12th floor at the end of a hall,  so it's very bright and quiet and has been an awesome place to study and live. The apartment also has a kitchen with refrigerator,  dishwasher,  stove,  and microwave,  as well as two large closets so there's plenty of storage space.The building has two gyms (one free for resident use and another member-only one that has more than the basics),  a party room,  and laundry downstairs,  as well as an outdoor pool. Covered and uncovered parking are available for an additional fee,  but there is plenty of street parking in this area. Management is receptive and service is quick. The concierge desk is available 24 hours a day.The building is located near Brigham Circle and the Longwood Medical Area,  so it's very close to local schools,  food shops,  Stop and Shop (5 minutes),  and the T (green line is one block away,  orange line is 7 minutes away). It's very close to Huntington Ave in a well-lit area,  so it's been safe at all times of day. Harvard Medical School,  MassArt,  and MCPHS are less than a 5 minute walk away,  Northeastern is 10 minutes away,  and the local hospitals (Boston Children's,  Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center,  and Brigham and Women's) are 7-12 minutes away.There are two roommates,  one who lives in the other bedroom and another who lives in the converted living room. We're both local female grad students in our twenties (one music major,  one medical student) who are friendly,  clean,  responsible,  and fairly quiet who are looking for the same. Female preferred; no couples or pets. Income verification is required by management.Rent is $1200/month and utilities (electricity and internet) run about $35 per month per person.

It's a fifth floor apartment in a building with an elevator. South facing,  so lots of light and sun in both the living room and bedroom. An island separates the (fairly small) open kitchen from the living/dining room. Big closet in bedroom,  smaller one by front door. Dishwasher in kitchen,  washer/dryer on the ground floor. Window A/C unit in living room. Leafy quiet street,  coffee shop next door,  5 minute walk to Harvard Square and metro,  very close to Cambridge Public Library and the park,  7-10 minute walk to Whole Foods and the bars/restaurants/shops in Inman Square,  walking distance from Central Square.Price includes all utilities (water,  heat,  high speed internet with wifi) except for electricity. Electricity is normally around $20 a month for us,  but may be more of you run the A/C a lot. The laundry machines downstairs take quarters. Parking can be arranged in lot downstairs for an extra $50/month.Important: must be able to care for and water our cherished plants. In return you get free,  fresh herbs,  and lots of greenery.Money: we're asking for an immediate deposit of one month and a half's rent that will confirm the sublet,  act as a security deposit,  and cover half of May plus your electricity costs. Then monthly rent by May 30,  June 30,  and July 30 for the following month. We'll pay up your electricity bills (and give you copies) and return any outstanding balance to you at the end. There may be some flexibility on start/end dates but we're looking for someone to take the apartment for the entire time we're gone.This is a lovely apartment and a great deal - we're looking for people that will take care of it.
