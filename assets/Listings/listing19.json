{"lat": "42.360129", "description": "), 2BR, 2100, This two-bedroom apartment near the N Harvard St/ Western Ave intersection is available for a late May or June 1st move-in. The three current tenants (me,  my partner,  and our roommate) will all move out by May's end.The apartment is in the very quiet neighborhood of Lower Allston. close to several grocery stores,  restaurants in the Brighton Ave/Commonwealth Ave area. There is a stop for Bus 66 at the end of the street and stops for the 70,  70A,  86. 64,  503 are within a 3 minute walk; the Harvard Ave Green B line is about a 10-12 minute walk away.The apartment itself is very cozy,  with ample space for several pieces of furniture in the living room,  dining room,  and kitchen. The living room has a small closet space and a small space next to the front entrance where we placed a large armoire for coats,  shoes,  etc. - its not visible in the living room photo.The two bedrooms are the same size and they fit a full/queen bed with space for a drawer,  a small desk and a nightstand. The closest bedroom to the front entrance has two doors; we keep one locked and use the one across from the bathroom for convenience. The closet space is small,  but there's enough space in the apartment (including the cellar) to store additional items.The kitchen is very large with lots of counter space. It comes with a fridge and dishwasher. We don't tend to use the dishwasher as its not a new model and feel its water-inefficient. There's no word from the landlord on whether they plan to update it,  but we would be more than happy to ask about this. There's also a washer/dryer downstairs you can use,  and a laundromat 3 minutes away if you'd rather wash clothes there.The apartment includes a front and back balcony,  and a small backyard area. Its a very nice set up for warmer months because you can easily barbecue and host gatherings without feeling cramped. The landlords don't mind parties,  but please - keep them civil. We also have some basic furniture available for cheap (some armoires,  a dresser,  a full size bed an boxspring) if you are interested.There's free street parking along the street and adjoining ones (some are permit parking,  though - it's a weird set up).The landlord is looking ONLY for long-term tenants - move in by end of May to sublet for June and July,  and sign a full-year's lease (August 1 2016 - July 31st 2017). Either two or three people can move in - either two room mates,  one couple,  or a couple and an additional roommate. You heard right,  folks - couples are welcome! Our current arrangement is couple + roommate; it's very comfortable and we never feel we invade each other's space.Rent (includes only water; tenants pay for heating,  electricity,  and internet) will consist of the following (NOTE: If you move in before June 1st we will pro-rate according to your move-in date):June & July 2016 - $2100 ($700 each if 3 tenants)August 2016 - July 2017 - $2250 ($150 rent increase,  so $750 each if 3 tenants)The rent is split equally among us as the landlord prefers it that way (to be fair) but for a couple + roommate situation,  you may be able to calculate shares based on square footage (the single person would pay more in this case) - you would need to discuss this directly with the landlord.Send me a message with preferred viewing times and a short description about you.
