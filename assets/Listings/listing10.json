The North End sits right above Downtown Boston,  and is bound by the Atlantic waterfront to the north and the east. In a sense,  the North End is its own little peninsula. After crossing the Tobin Bridge,  to the west lies Cambridge,  and even further north,  Charlestown. Across the water to the east lies Logan International Airport,  New England's busiest airport that flies over 30 million passengers annually. The North End has maintained its historic,  Italian roots,  and those searching for an apartment will enjoy the rustic,  exposed brick buildings and the tiny cobblestone streets.Although the North End does not have a direct MTBA stop,  there are plenty of surrounding stops and streets leading into the neighborhood. The closest stops are Aquarium on the Blue Line,  Haymarket on the Orange Line,  and North Station. North Station is a commuter rail line travelled by thousands of inbound and outbound commuters from the North Shore and central regions of Massachusetts.", "long": "", "heading": "950ft2 - AMAZING find!
